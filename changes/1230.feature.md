`RESTClientImpl` improvements:
 - You can now share client sessions and bucket managers across these objects or have them created for you.
 - Speedup of request lifetime
 - No-ratelimit routes no longer attempt to acquire rate limits
   - Just for safety, a check is in place to treat the route as a rate limited route if a bucket is ever received for it and a error log is emitted. If you spot it around, please inform us!
