Bots can now utilize `Activity.state`
- When used with `type` set to `ActivityType.CUSTOM`, it will show as the text for the custom status.
  Syntactic sugar also exists to support simply using `name` instead of `state`.
- Can be used with other activity types to provide additional information on the activity.
