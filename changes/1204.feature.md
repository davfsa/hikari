Improve components lifetimes:
- `GatewayBot`:
  - Fix a lot of edge cases of hard crashes if the application shuts down while starting.
  - `run`' `shard_ids` argument can now be a `typing.Sequence`.
  - General optimizations
- `RESTBot`:
  - Correct and consistent signal handling with `GatewayBot`.
- `GatewayShardImpl`:
  - General optimizations.
  - New `is_connected` property to determine whether the shard is connected to the gateway.
